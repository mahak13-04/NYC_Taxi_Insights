# NYC Taxi Data Analysis & Business Insights

The following project develops extensive data cleaning, transformation, and EDA on New York City Taxi Trip Data. It aims to extract primary patterns in taxi demand, fare trends, traffic behavior, and payment preferences and ultimately translate them into business opportunities for taxi operators and policymakers.


## Overview of Project

This project analyzes, using publicly available NYC Taxi datasets, how factors like the time of day, trip distance, borough zones, and payment modes affect overall performance and profitability.

This analysis would uncover opportunities for improving:

1. Driver efficiency and availability

2. Fare optimization and tipping behavior

3. Balancing demand with sustainability


## Data Cleaning & Transformation

Basic preprocessing steps include:

1. Removing invalid or duplicate records

2. Handling null and missing values

3. Converting timestamps to meaningful features - hour, day, and whether weekday or weekend

4. Filtering negative or unrealistic fares/distances

5. Merging with zone lookup data for borough-wise insights


## Data Exploration-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Main Insights:

1. Peak demand is observed during evening hours, namely from 5 to 9 PM, and during weekdays, particularly Thursday to Friday.

2. The busiest pickup zones are: Midtown, JFK, and Penn Station.

3. Credit cards dominate the means of paying for a purchase, with an approximate percentage of 86%, reflecting strong digital adoption.

3. Fare increases linearly with trip distance, confirming a stable pricing model.

4. Tipping peaks at 3-4 PM and is usually related to airport or business trips.

5. Highest traffic congestion is between 7 AM–7 PM, especially midweek.

## Outcome:
This project transforms raw transportation data into practical insights that can guide better business strategies for the NYC taxi ecosystem. It also shows how analytics mixed with operational innovation can work to drive smarter mobility solutions.
